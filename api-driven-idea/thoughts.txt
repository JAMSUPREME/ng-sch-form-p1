External API
  Menu
  Personal Info
    You (includes family and friends)
    Your pets

all-about-you.org
/
  get: menu
/people
  /{id}


finances.org (assume some HR system)
/
    get: menu
/people
    salary


Internal API
  *would also handle tokens, auth, mappings, etc.
  Profile (just user info)
    Also dupes data to finances api?
  family info split into separate page on our UI for people


--
-- Step 1 - A front end to an API (for now rolling a custom thing)
--
- Build generic front end that gets the root, builds nav (assume it's a form), then exposes CRUD on the resource


--
-- Food for thought
--
- Specs that can assist in accomplishing this: Swagger, RAML, JSON-Home
